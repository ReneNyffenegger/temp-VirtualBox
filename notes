Auto capture keyboard {

  You have the *Auto capture keyboard* option turned on.
  -> This will cause the Virtual Machine to automatically capture the keyboard
     every time the VM window is activated and make it unavailable to other applications
     runnint on your host machine: when the keyboard is captured, ally keystrokes (including
     system ones like Alt-Tab) will be directed to the VM


}
Mouse pointer integration

  The Virtual Machine reports that the guest OS does not support *mouse poitner integration* in the
  current video mode.
  You need to capture the mouse (by clicking over th VM display or pressing the host key) in order
  to use the mouse inside the guest OS.

  Any program using the Main API will first need access to the global VirtualBox object (see
  IVirtualBox), from which all other functionality of the API is derived.
